  "question": "\n        A truck is pulling a car. Let FT be the magnitude of the force that the\n    truck exerts on the car and let FC be the magnitude of the force that the car exerts on the truck.\n    If the truck is speeding up while driving up a mountain and friction is negligible, how does the\n    magnitude of FT compare to FC?\n    A. FT > FC\n    B. FC > FT\n    C. FT = FC = 0\n    D. FT = FC > 0\n    ",
