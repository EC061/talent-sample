Question: 
        A truck is pulling a car. Let FT be the magnitude of the force that the
    truck exerts on the car and let FC be the magnitude of the force that the car exerts on the truck.
    If the truck is speeding up while driving up a mountain and friction is negligible, how does the
    magnitude of FT compare to FC?
    A. FT > FC
    B. FC > FT
    C. FT = FC = 0
    D. FT = FC > 0
    

Student's Wrong Answer: C. FT = FC = 0
Correct Answer: D. FT = FC > 0

File: Day13-Phys1111_09_15_2025_Forces.pdf
Key Concepts: Definition of force, Measuring force in newtons, Visualizing forces as vectors, Types of contact and long-range forces, Drawing free body diagrams
Description: This section explains force as a push or pull, measured in newtons, and visualized as vectors with magnitude and direction. It covers contact forces like tension and friction, and long-range forces like gravity. Students learn to draw free body diagrams by identifying all forces acting on an object, which is essential for solving mechanics problems.

File: Day14-Phys1111_09_17_2025_Newton’sLawsofMotion.pdf
Key Concepts: Newton's First Law, Law of Inertia, Mechanical Equilibrium, Newton's Second Law, Action and Reaction
Description: This material covers Newton's three laws of motion, focusing on inertia, force-acceleration relationships, and action-reaction pairs. It explains how objects behave under zero or nonzero net forces and introduces free-body diagrams and coordinate systems for problem solving. Typical problems involve calculating forces, accelerations, or normal forces in physical scenarios like a bobsled team pushing a sled.

File: Day15-Phys1111_09_19_2025_Connectedobjects.pdf
Key Concepts: Newton's Second Law, Massless Frictionless Pulleys, Connected Objects Motion, Tension in Strings, Coordinate Systems for Forces
Description: This section covers applying Newton's Second Law to systems of connected objects, often using massless, frictionless pulleys. Key ideas include constant tension in ideal strings and using consistent coordinate systems to analyze forces. Problems typically involve finding accelerations and tensions in multi-body systems, requiring free-body diagrams and force summation along chosen axes.

File: Day16-Phys1111_09_22_2025_Friction.pdf
Key Concepts: Static Friction, Kinetic Friction, Coefficient of Friction, Normal Force, Overcoming Static Friction
Description: This material covers friction, the force opposing relative motion between surfaces. It distinguishes static friction, which prevents motion onset, from kinetic friction, which resists ongoing sliding. Key concepts include coefficients of friction and their dependence on normal force. Problems typically involve calculating whether an object moves and its resulting acceleration under applied forces.

File: Day17-Phys1111_09_24_2025_Force_practiceI.pdf
Key Concepts: inclined plane analysis, rotated coordinate systems, force decomposition on ramps, normal force calculation, friction and acceleration
Description: This section covers forces on inclined planes, using rotated coordinates to simplify problems. It teaches how to resolve gravity into components parallel and perpendicular to the ramp, calculate normal force, and handle friction. Example problems involve pushing furniture up ramps or parcels sliding down, applying Newton’s laws to find forces, accelerations, and velocities.
