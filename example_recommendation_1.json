Let FT be the magnitude of the force that the\n    truck exerts on the car and let FC be the magnitude of the force that the car exerts on the truck.\n    If the truck is speeding up while driving up a mountain and friction is negligible, how does the\n    magnitude of FT compare to FC?\n    A. FT > FC\n    B. FC > FT\n    C. FT = FC = 0\n    D. FT = FC > 0\n    ",

    "reasoning": "The student incorrectly assumed no forces exist (FT=FC=0), but the question involves Newton's Third Law where action-reaction pairs are always equal and opposite. The selected file explicitly covers action-reaction pairs and clarifies that forces between two objects are equal regardless of motion, which directly addresses the misconception.",
