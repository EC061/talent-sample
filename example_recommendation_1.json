  "question": "\n        A truck is pulling a car. Let FT be the magnitude of the force that the\n    truck exerts on the car and let FC be the magnitude of the force that the car exerts on the truck.\n    If the truck is speeding up while driving up a mountain and friction is negligible, how does the\n    magnitude of FT compare to FC?\n    A. FT > FC\n    B. FC > FT\n    C. FT = FC = 0\n    D. FT = FC > 0\n    ",

    "reasoning": "The question involves two connected objects (truck and car) and the forces between them, which directly relates to the concept of tension and Newton's Second Law in connected systems. The student's incorrect answer suggests a misunderstanding of action-reaction pairs and force magnitudes in such systems, which is precisely the focus of the connected objects material, including the principle that tension forces are equal in magnitude (FT = FC) when the string is massless and ideal.",
