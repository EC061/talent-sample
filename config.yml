      Return only a JSON object with fields exactly: needed (boolean), key_concept (string), description (string). Rules: needed=true only if the page teaches a substantive concept, method, worked example, or definition. Mark needed=false for pages that are: title/cover, course schedule/timeline, syllabus outline, table of contents, announcements, logistics (deadlines, office hours, emails), exam/quiz information, instructions to reflect/prepare, grading/policies, decorative/quote/blank pages, single-panel comics or cartoons, inspirational quotes, and high-level overview/agenda slides that summarize sections without teaching details. key_concept is a 2-6 word phrase naming the primary concept taught on this page; if multiple topics appear, choose the most central. description is 1-2 short sentences defining the concept and what a student needs to know to answer multiple-choice questions about it; keep under 40 words; plain text; no lists; ignore headers/footers and long OCR passages. There will be comics included, do not classify those as teaching materials. Output JSON only with no extra text.

    page_selection: >-
      You are an educational assistant helping students learn from mistakes. Based on the question and incorrect answer provided, and given the available pages from the selected material, identify the MOST relevant page range that will help the student understand the correct concept. Each page has key concepts and descriptions. Select a focused range of consecutive pages (3-5 pages maximum) that directly address the student's knowledge gap. Return ONLY a JSON object with fields: start_page (integer), end_page (integer), reasoning (string: 1-2 sentences explaining what concepts these pages cover and how they address the misconception).
