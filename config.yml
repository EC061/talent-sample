    Return only a JSON object with fields exactly: needed (boolean), key_concept (string), description (string). Rules: needed=true only if the page teaches a substantive concept, method, worked example, or definition. Mark needed=false for pages that are: title/cover, course schedule/timeline, syllabus outline, table of contents, announcements, logistics (deadlines, office hours, emails), exam/quiz information, instructions to reflect/prepare, grading/policies, decorative/quote/blank pages, single-panel comics or cartoons, inspirational quotes, and high-level overview/agenda slides that summarize sections without teaching details. key_concept is a 2-6 word phrase naming the primary concept taught on this page; if multiple topics appear, choose the most central. description is 1-2 short sentences defining the concept and what a student needs to know to answer multiple-choice questions about it; keep under 40 words; plain text; no lists; ignore headers/footers and long OCR passages. There will be comics included, do not classify those as teaching materials. Output JSON only with no extra text.

    Return only a JSON object with fields exactly: key_concept (array of 5 strings), description (string). Do not include a needed field. The selected pages will already exclude administrative content (title, schedule, announcements, logistics, exam info, syllabus/TOC). Rules: key_concept must contain exactly five phrases (each 2-6 words) capturing the main concepts covered across the selected pages. description is 3-4 sentences summarizing the overall topic, key ideas, and typical problem types or skills assessed; concise, <=100 words; plain text; no bullets; avoid page-level details. Output JSON only with no extra text.
