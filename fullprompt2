You are an educational assistant helping students learn from mistakes. Based on the question and incorrect answer provided, and given the available pages from the selected material, identify the MOST relevant page range that will help the student understand the correct concept. Each page has key concepts and descriptions. Select a focused range of consecutive pages (3-5 pages maximum) that directly address the student's knowledge gap. Return ONLY a JSON object with fields: start_page (integer), end_page (integer), reasoning (string: 1-2 sentences explaining what concepts these pages cover and how they address the misconception).

Question: 
        A truck is pulling a car. Let FT be the magnitude of the force that the
    truck exerts on the car and let FC be the magnitude of the force that the car exerts on the truck.
    If the truck is speeding up while driving up a mountain and friction is negligible, how does the
    magnitude of FT compare to FC?
    A. FT > FC
    B. FC > FT
    C. FT = FC = 0
    D. FT = FC > 0
    

Student's Wrong Answer: C. FT = FC = 0
Correct Answer: D. FT = FC > 0

  Key Concept: Law of Inertia
  Description: An object’s velocity stays constant unless a net force acts on it. This means stationary objects stay still and moving objects keep moving at the same speed and direction if no unbalanced force is present.

  Key Concept: Law of Inertia
  Description: An object’s velocity stays constant unless a net force acts on it. Stationary objects stay at rest; moving ones keep constant speed and direction when no net force is present.

  Key Concept: Law of Inertia
  Description: An object’s velocity stays constant unless a net force acts on it. Stationary objects stay still; moving ones keep constant speed and direction without external force.

  Key Concept: Mechanical Equilibrium
  Description: An object is in mechanical equilibrium when the net force acting on it equals zero, meaning all forces cancel out and the object remains at rest or moves with constant velocity.

Page 12:
  Key Concept: Inertial Reference Frame
  Description: An inertial reference frame moves at constant velocity and obeys Newton’s First Law. Accelerating frames are not inertial, as objects appear to accelerate without force.

  Key Concept: Mass and Inertia
  Description: Mass (m, unit kg) is an object’s intrinsic property that measures its resistance to changes in velocity, also known as inertia.

Page 14:
  Key Concept: Mass and Weight
  Description: Mass (m, kg) is an object’s inertia; weight (N) is gravity’s force on it. Near Earth, weight equals mass times gravity: F_G = mg.

  Key Concept: Newton's Second Law
  Description: Force equals mass times acceleration. The net force vector determines the direction and magnitude of an object’s acceleration, calculated by summing all individual forces acting on it.

  Key Concept: Free-Body Diagrams
  Description: A free-body diagram shows all forces acting on an object. Students must identify and draw these forces correctly to apply Newton’s Second Law in problem solving.

  Key Concept: Newton's Second Law Method
  Description: Solve force problems by drawing free-body diagrams and choosing a coordinate system aligned with acceleration to simplify calculations using F=ma.

  Key Concept: Newton's Second Law Method
  Description: A step-by-step approach to solve force problems using free-body diagrams, coordinate systems, and vector component resolution to apply F=ma effectively.

  Key Concept: Newton's Second Law Method
  Description: A step-by-step method to solve force problems using free-body diagrams, coordinate systems, and component equations: sum of forces equals mass times acceleration in each direction.

  Key Concept: Newton's Second Law Method
  Description: A step-by-step approach to solve force problems using free-body diagrams, coordinate systems, and component equations for x and y directions to find unknowns.

  Key Concept: Newton's Third Law
  Description: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Forces always occur in pairs between two interacting objects.

  Key Concept: Newton's Third Law
  Description: For every action force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force acting on the two interacting objects. These forces are always paired and act on different objects.

  Key Concept: Newton's Third Law
  Description: For every action force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force between two interacting objects. These forces act on different objects and are always paired.

Page 24:
  Key Concept: Newton's Third Law
  Description: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. These paired forces act on different objects and are always equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Page 25:
  Key Concept: Newton's Second Law
  Description: Force equals mass times acceleration. When multiple forces act at angles, resolve them into components to find net force and motion along each axis.

Page 26:
  Key Concept: Newton's Second Law
  Description: Force equals mass times acceleration. Use F=ma to find net force, then resolve forces into components to solve for individual applied forces or normal force in inclined push scenarios.
